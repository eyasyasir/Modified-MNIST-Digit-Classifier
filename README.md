# Largest Digit Detector
## Overview
This model was created for the purpose of Assignment 4 of the MAIS 202: Winter 2021 bootcamp. The objective of this assignment was to design and implement a system to classify images of handwritten digits, specifically predicting the largest number present in the image. The assignment was run as a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mais-202-winter-2021-kaggle-comp/overview).
## Instructions

 1. Add a shortcut of the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Z5fhU01pcDhV0QMgOXhnvxRb0HLWxJs?usp=sharing) to your personal drive.
 2. To train the model simply run the [model training colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mru1cLZShj7X1WYFqaduvEkPjlW0uh_I).
 
 *Make sure to assign a name for the model's weight to the `WEIGHTS_FILENAME` variable in the last code cell. (For example: 'model_test.h5')*

 3. To make predictions on the test_x.npy file provided in the dataset folder, simply run the [model predictions colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17eu1rKGpcmZX9ClhMuvo1on9JfomduMY#scrollTo=M6bFnpXWp_IW). 
 
 *Make sure to assign a name for the model's weight to the `WEIGHTS_FILENAME` variable in the last code cell (the filename should be the same as the one used in step 2.*

 4. The the predictions will be saved to the virtual machine's local storage with the filename `predictions.csv`.
